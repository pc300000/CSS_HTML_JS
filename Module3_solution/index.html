        Chicken

      <div class="col-title-sub-content">
        Chicken has well-documented health benefits, but different parts and  preparation methods factor into how healthy your chicken-based meal turns out. Darker cuts like the thigh and drumstick contain higher caloric content than lighter cuts like the breast. Keeping the skin or frying chicken will also add saturated fat. 
        Supports Muscle Growth and Repair: Chicken is rich in protein, which provides the building blocks necessary for muscle
        growth and repair. Consuming adequate protein from sources like chicken can help support muscle development and
        recovery, especially for individuals engaged in regular exercise or strength training.<br /><br />
        
        Aids Weight Management: Due to its high protein content and low-fat profile, chicken can help promote satiety and reduce
        appetite, making it an excellent choice for individuals looking to manage their weight or support weight loss goals.
        Incorporating chicken into meals can help keep you feeling full and satisfied for longer periods, reducing the
        likelihood of overeating.<br />
        
        Promotes Heart Health: Chicken is a good source of niacin (vitamin B3) and selenium, both of which play important roles
        in promoting heart health. Niacin helps lower cholesterol levels and supports cardiovascular function, while selenium
        acts as an antioxidant, protecting the heart from oxidative stress and inflammation.

        Beef

      <div class="col-title-sub-content">
        Beef is the meat of cattle (Bos taurus). It is categorized as red meat â€” a term used for the meat of mammals, which contains higher amounts of iron than chicken or fish. Usually eaten as roasts, ribs, or steaks, beef is also commonly ground or minced. Patties of ground beef are often used in hamburgers. Processed beef products include corned beef, beef jerky, and sausages. Fresh, lean beef is rich in various vitamins and minerals, especially iron and zinc. Therefore, moderate intake of beef can be recommended as part of a healthy diet (1Trusted Source). <br /> <br />

        Supports Muscle Health: Beef is a rich source of protein, making it an ideal food for supporting muscle health and
        strength. Protein from beef provides the necessary amino acids required for muscle repair and growth, making it
        beneficial for athletes, bodybuilders, and individuals looking to maintain muscle mass as they age. <br />
        
        Provides Iron for Energy Production: Beef is an excellent source of heme iron, the type of iron that is most readily
        absorbed by the body. Iron is essential for the production of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries
        oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Adequate iron intake from sources like beef helps prevent iron deficiency
        anemia and supports overall energy production and vitality.

        Sushi
      </div>
      <div class="col-title-sub-content">
        Sushi is a combination of many ingredients, so the nutrition profile is diverse. Sushi rice is a great source of carbohydrates and has negligible fat. The seaweed wrapper, nori, is rich in iodine. Seafood is the main ingredient of the dish that contains omega-3 fatty acids and selenium in large quantities. Different types of fish added in it contain different minerals and vitamins. The fruits and vegetables (avocado, cucumber, etc.) also add to its benefits.<br /><br />

        Supports Heart Health: The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish have been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease by
        lowering levels of triglycerides, reducing inflammation, and improving blood vessel function. Regular consumption of
        sushi may help lower blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and the risk of developing cardiovascular problems.<br />
        
        Promotes Brain Health: Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for brain health and cognitive function. Studies have shown
        that omega-3s may help improve memory, concentration, and mood, while reducing the risk of age-related cognitive decline
        and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.<br />
        
        Provides Essential Nutrients: Sushi is a source of essential nutrients such as protein, vitamins (e.g., B vitamins),
        minerals (e.g., iodine, selenium), and antioxidants. These nutrients support various bodily functions, including immune
        function, metabolism, energy production, and cell repair.
